2024-01-10 15:31:58,I think what kills apple cal for me is that my reminders don’t show up in it like with other apps. No clue why Apple doesn’t allow for this,126,2024-01-10 14:22:17,Why Apple? Ios calendar vs samsung calendar,760,200,https://i.redd.it/6iu3z37qgmbc1.jpeg

2024-01-10 19:43:26,"I yearn for a day where everything across iOS is integrated with the calendar. When you think about it, all of the content across every app has a timestamp, and it would be awesome to see it all show up in a unified calendar. Reminders, messages, photos, notes, music, emails, weather, files, hell, even voicemails! All of it has a date attached to it somehow. The calendar app should be a life planner and digital diary, where everything on your phone is magically sorted by date and time. 

Obviously, this should be an “a la carte” opt-in system, where each user can filter only the content they want to see. The new journal app is getting close to this, but it’s not quite the same as seeing your whole calendar.",20,2024-01-10 14:22:17,Why Apple?
